## Overview

Metro Operations Optimization involves enhancing the efficiency of metro services by analyzing data and making operational adjustments. This project focuses on:

- Reducing overcrowding.
- Aligning service frequency with demand.
- Improving resource utilization and passenger satisfaction.

## Dataset Details

The dataset includes the following components:

- **Agency**: Metro corporation details (e.g., name, URL, contacts).
- **Calendar**: Service schedules (weekdays, weekends, valid dates).
- **Routes**: Details of metro routes.
- **Shapes**: Geographical route coordinates.
- **Stop Times**: Timetables for trips.
- **Stops**: Locations of metro stops (latitude, longitude).
- **Trips**: Links between trips and routes.

## Steps to Optimize Metro Operations

1. **Route Visualization**: Plotting geographical routes to understand connectivity.
2. **Frequency Analysis**: Analyzing the number of trips across weekdays and weekends.
3. **Connectivity Analysis**: Identifying key hubs and transfer points.
4. **Interval Analysis**: Evaluating trip intervals during different times of the day.
5. **Optimization**: Adjusting frequencies based on demand.

## Visualizations and Insights

### 1. Geographical Routes

Visualize the metro network to understand route coverage and connectivity.

### 2. Trip Frequency by Day

A bar chart illustrating:
- Consistent weekday schedules.
- Reduced weekend trips due to lower demand.

### 3. Stop Connectivity

A scatter plot showing:
- Major hubs with high connectivity.
- Peripheral stops with fewer routes.

### 4. Service Frequency

A bar chart showing average trip intervals:
- Shorter intervals during peak hours.
- Longer intervals during off-peak hours.

## Optimizations Implemented

Based on demand patterns, the following adjustments were made:

- **Morning and Evening Peaks**: Increased the number of trips by 20%, anticipating higher demand during these hours. This adjustment aims to reduce overcrowding and improve passenger comfort and service reliability.
- **Midday and Late Evening**: Decreased the trips by 10%, assuming that the demand drops during these times, allowing for more efficient use of resources without significantly impacting service quality

## Technologies Used

- **Python Libraries**:
  - Pandas for data manipulation.
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.
  

- **Environment**:
  - Jupyter Notebook or Python IDE.

## Results

- Improved peak-hour services by increasing train frequency.
- Reduced off-peak trips without affecting service quality.
- Visualizations provided actionable insights into metro operations.
